Install on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint)
-------
There are 3 ways you can do this.

1. Static binary way (Doesnt need root or any installed dependencies)
    - Download archived binary file from latest [release](https://github.com/kunesj/omad/releases).
    - Extract "omad" folder to anywhere you like, and link "omad" executable to ~/bin (or /usr/local/bin)

    ln -s /path/to/extracted/folder/omad /home/$(whoami)/bin/omad

    - Extract omad.desktop to ~/.local/share/application or /usr/local/share/applications
    - You can now start OMAD with shortcut from global menu or from commandline with "omad" command

2. Package install way (Proper Python way)
    - Download archived source from latest [release](https://github.com/kunesj/omad/releases).
    - Extract it anywhere you want
    - In terminal in folder with extracted files, run: "make all"
    - Remove folder with extracted source
    - You can now start OMAD with shortcut from global menu or from commandline with "omad" command

3. Source only way (For developers)
    - Download archived source from latest [release](https://github.com/kunesj/omad/releases).
    - Extract it anywhere you want
    - In terminal in folder with extracted files, run: "make install_dep" to install runtime dependencies
    - You can only start OMAD from commandline, by directly using Python interpreter (python -m omad)

Install on Windows (Not tested for current version!)
-------  
You can download archived binary file from latest [release](https://github.com/kunesj/omad/releases) and just use that, or you can follow these instructions and install everything manualy. (When binary for some reason doesnt work)

1. Install Python 3
    - Download [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) installer (includes pip and setuptools)
    - Run installer and select to add python to system path

2. Install PyQt4
    - Download [Python 3.x - PyQt4](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyqt4) wheels package
    - From commandline in folder with downloaded file run following command, you will need to modify it for correct filename:

    pip3 install PyQt4-4.?.?-cp3?-none-win32.whl

3. Install rest of runtime dependencies
    - From commandline run following command:

    pip3 install requests beautifulsoup4

4. Install OMAD
    - Get zipped [source](https://github.com/kunesj/omad/releases) and extract it anywhere you want
    - Run following commands from folder with extracted files, to finish installation:

    python3 setup.py build

    python3 setup.py install

    - You can now start OMAD from commandline with "omad" command, optionally you can also create shortcut with this command

Installing/Running from Source 
-------
When installing or running from downloaded source, do not forget to run:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
to download submodules

Building static binary
-------

1. Linux
    - In terminal in omad folder, run: "make build_dep" to install build dependencies
    - Then run: "make build" to build binary and package it together with source into tar archive

2. Windows (Not tested for current version!)
    - Follow installation instructions, until you install all dependencies
    - Download and install [pywin32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32) (make sure it's Python 3 version)
    - Download and install [MSVCR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29)
    - Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), in installation select to use git from windows commandline
    - Install PyInstaller with:

    pip3 install pyinstaller

    - Now go to folder with OMAD source files and run: "build_win.bat" to build binary and package it together with source into zip archive
